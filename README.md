# MathematicalArt_Magical_Square

"Magical Square" is one of Pure Mathematics and Fine Art crossover artwork, that was inspired accidentally by I noticed an art piece on the wall of a hospital corridor since I suffering from some emergency medical condition after jabs of vaccine in 2021.

Creating artwork during chronic pain to distract away from sickness, and step into the true wilderness realm of pure mathematics, to discover by curiosity and aesthetics, but is not really useful in a range of observables and we know, currently.

Later than, or perhaps, somehow someone works on an ingenious problem maybe 50 or 100 years later, they discover these old realms may be the exact things they need to solve problems.Fine art tells the difference between decorative and applied art (aka. design), one of the ways is created primarily for aesthetic and intellectual purposes, judged (tasted) for its beauty.
